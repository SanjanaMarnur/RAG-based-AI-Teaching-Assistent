I am going to give you an exercise in which I will explain you a faulty calculator. What kind of input and output your calculator gives you. And you have to make a faulty calculator exactly according to that. I will tell you the exact question in a while. But you guys like this video and write Challenge Accepted in the comment section below. If you guys plan to solve this. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's build the intro. So guys, today's exercise is very simple. So what you have to do is make a faulty calculator. So what I will do here is quickly make a folder named Video 59. Oops, I made it in the name of Video 50. I want to make it in the name of Video 59. Video 59 And what I will do here is open it. With your VS Code And you have to make a faulty calculator with the help of NodeJS. You guys don't make Index.html at all. You guys make Index.js. And by making Index.js, the problem statement is Create a faulty calculator. Okay, I will comment out a little. And I am going to use the multi-line comment here. So that you guys don't have any problem. You guys should see the problem statement clearly. Create a faulty calculator using JavaScript. This faulty calculator does following. It takes two numbers as input from the user. Okay. So two numbers will be taken from the user as an input. Okay. This is number one. This is the first thing that this faulty calculator will do. The second thing that this faulty calculator will do is That it will do instead of addition. Addition, it performs wrong operations as follows. Okay. So what will it do instead of plus? It will perform minus instead of plus. It will perform plus instead of multiply. Then what will it do instead of minus? It will perform divide. And it will perform exponentiation instead of divide. Okay. So you have to make a faulty calculator like this. Which will do wrong operations. And the mistake that this will do It will do only 10% of the times. Okay. So here 10% of the times is a catch. Okay. It performs wrong operations 10% of the times. Okay. Now what does it mean to understand this? If anyone uses this calculator. Assume that the exam is taking place. Now you have not allowed the calculator in the exam. Let's assume that. Now it has been said that the calculator is not to be used in the exam. But if anyone wants to use it, then the calculator is given to him. Use this one. Now he does not know that this is a faulty calculator. See if we do this, then obviously things will be visible. It will do 1 plus 1. So it will directly show that 1 minus 1 has happened. Which will become zero. He will say that this is the right calculator. But we have to confuse. So we have to perform the calculation with 10% probability. How will this happen? This will happen by generating a random number. You generate a random number between 1 to 100. And by generating that random number. What do you have to do? To find out whether it is greater than 10 or less than 10. Now generate a random number between 1 to 100. Now I will give you some context. If you have not accessed these notes, then you will have to access it. But I just want to give you. I am going to open the note wrapper. So I will write the note here first. I will zoom in to show you. Now if I write here A is equal to. And I write mad.random. So you see that a random number is being generated. Which is between 0 and 1. So you do not even need to generate between 1 to 100. I will just see whether this number is less than 0.1 or not. So I will see whether it is less than 0.1 or not. No, no, no, no. In most of the cases, this will not happen. Because the probability of 10% is very low. And you see here, it would have performed wrong. Calculator would have done the wrong calculation. If anyone would have used it. So this is what we have to do. We have to make a faulty calculator. So you guys use this function. And use fls. Make a faulty calculator. I am waiting for you. I have already told you a lot of things. Now I want to test this practical information. So quickly write the challenge accepted. And post your solution. Because whoever solves it, I will give him a shoutout. If you have not accessed this playlist yet. Then click here to access. Click here to save it. And click here to bookmark. If you are not doing it, then do it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music."}
